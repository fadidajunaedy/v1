                <p>
                    I am a web developer who enjoys turning ideas into <em>functional</em> and <em>useful web applications</em>. My focus is on creating user experiences that are <em>simple, engaging, and easy to use</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, majoring in Informatics Engineering, from a private university in Jakarta three months ago. I recently completed an internship at an NGO, Madani Berkelanjutan, where I worked as a Full Stack Web Developer Intern. During my internship, I contributed to redesigning the organization’s website and implementing new features to enhance its functionality and user experience.

                    I am constantly learning and evolving as a developer, exploring <em>new technologies</em> and <em>methodologies</em> to improve my skills. My goal is to build web solutions that not only meet functional requirements but also provide a <em>meaningful impact</em> on users. I look forward to collaborating on projects that <em>challenge me</em> and contribute to creating better digital experiences.
